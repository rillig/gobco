	// Since the left-hand side in an assignment must be a variable,
	// and since only those expressions are instrumented that are
	// syntactically bool, the instrumented code never converts an
	// lvalue to an rvalue.

	// The instrumentation wraps each condition with a function call,
	// so the order of evaluation becomes more deterministic, see
	// https://go.dev/ref/spec#Order_of_evaluation.

	// The operators '|=' and '&=' are not defined on bool,
	// they are only defined on integer types.
